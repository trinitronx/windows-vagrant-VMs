Microsoft has introduced, modern.IE, a new way for developers to test Websites for compatibility with Internet Explorer. Modern.IE is a free set of tools and resources designed to make it easier for developers to ensure their sites work beautifully across Internet Explorer as well as other modern browsers. Ryan Gavin, general manager of Internet Explorer at Microsoft, said in a blog post. "As part of the modern.IE release, we're excited to announce a special partnership with BrowserStack, a leading browser testing service that lets developers test their site on any browser on any Windows OS. For any Web developer that visits BrowserStack via modern.IE, we're offering three months of this service for free over the next year," Gavin said. Modern.IE features a wizard that scans for common coding practices that might prevent users from having their best experience on a site. Developers start by entering a Web page URL that they want to test and modern.IE returns a report on the compatibility issues. In honor of the release of the modern.IE, here are a few reasons developers should check out IE again.
